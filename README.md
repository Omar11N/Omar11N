# Hi there, I'm Omar ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Machine Learning Engineer** with a strong focus on **reinforcement learning, robotics simulation, and sim2real transfer**.  
My academic and research work bridges AI and robotics, particularly in simulation environments like **MuJoCo, Unity Physics, PyBullet, Isaac Sim, and Gazebo**.  

I enjoy developing intelligent agents that can transfer from simulation to the real world, leveraging techniques such as **domain randomization, policy optimization (PPO, SAC), and system identification**.  
My MSc research on *Morphological Computation as an Intrinsic Reward* was published at an international conference (**GSO 2025**).  

Currently, Iâ€™m also building a **mental health mobile app** with **Flask (backend)** and **React Native (frontend)**, where I integrate AI-driven features to support well-being.
